### holbertonschool-machine_learning
This repository contains all the machine learning projects done in Holberton school.
It is where the fundamentals of machine learning are.
It contains 3 folders, which are the 3 sub-parts of machine learning:
**Supervised machine_learning**
**unsupervised machine_learning**
**reinforcement machine_learning**

## Experience
To be fair, the experience is a challenging one, since the field itself is new, finding good explanatory resources and understanding is very hard. At the beginning of the specialization, we started by the basics of the supervised learning where we learned the ABCs of the field, and grew the knowledge from there. Then we moved to the unsupervised learning part which involved more dealings with the data and statistics which was even more challenging and finally the reinforcement learning.
The machine learning experience is enriching and wide at the same time, it is still going, so changes will be made in the future for this repo
